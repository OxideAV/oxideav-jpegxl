## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.5](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-jpegxl/compare/v0.0.4...v0.0.5) - 2026-05-07

### Other

- update Cargo.toml dependencies

### Added

- New `ans` module implementing the FDIS 18181-1:2021 Annex D entropy
  layer (round 1 of the committee-draft → FDIS migration). Submodules:
  - `ans::prefix` — Brotli (RFC 7932) §3.4 simple + §3.5 complex
    prefix codes, used by the `use_prefix_code == 1` histogram path
    of D.3.1.
  - `ans::alias` — alias-mapping table init + lookup (D.3.2,
    Listings D.1 + D.2). Implements Vose's alias method with the
    spec PDF's u/o/i variable typo corrected.
  - `ans::symbol` — 32-bit-state ANS reverse decoder (D.3.3,
    Listing D.3) including the `0x130000` end-of-stream check.
  - `ans::distribution` — ANS distribution decoder (D.3.4,
    Listing D.4) with the verbatim 128 × 2 `kLogCountLut` lookup
    table transcribed from p. 64 of the FDIS PDF.
  - `ans::cluster` — distribution clustering simple-path + the
    inverse move-to-front transform (D.3.5, Listing D.5).
  - `ans::hybrid` — hybrid-integer LZ77 decode driver (D.3.6,
    Listing D.6) with the verbatim 120 × 2 `kSpecialDistances`
    lookup table transcribed from p. 66 of the FDIS PDF, plus a
    1 MiB sliding window per stream.
  - `ans::hybrid_config` — `HybridUintConfig` decode + `ReadUint`
    (D.3.7, Listing D.7).
  Every allocation is bounded against the input length; the
  module ships 45 self-contained unit tests covering hand-built
  bitstreams from each spec listing plus four malicious-input
  cases (oversized log_alphabet_size, oversized alphabet, huge
  hybrid token, huge prefix-code alphabet).
  The committee-draft `abrac` / `begabrac` / `matree` / `modular`
  pipeline and the registered `make_decoder` are intentionally
  untouched — round 2 will wire the new ANS coder behind a
  FrameHeader + TOC entry point.
- `BitReader` gains `peek_bits(n)` / `advance_bits(n)` / `bits_remaining()`
  / `read_u8_value()` to support the ANS distribution decoder
  (D.3.4 reads `u(7)` for the kLogCountLut key without advancing,
  then advances by the table-derived step count).

- Modular sub-bitstream channel decoder per the 2019 committee draft
  (`arxiv-1908.03565v2`, Annexes C.9 + D.7), a stepping stone toward
  full FDIS 18181-1 support. New modules:
  - `abrac` — bit-level adaptive range coder (D.7).
  - `begabrac` — bounded-Exp-Golomb integer coder over a known signed
    range, layered on `abrac` (D.7.1).
  - `matree` — meta-adaptive decision tree that picks a per-context
    BEGABRAC for each pixel (D.7.2 / D.7.3).
  - `predictors` — five named pixel predictors (Zero, Average,
    Gradient, Left, Top) from C.9.3.1.
  - `modular` — channel-header parser plus the per-pixel property +
    predictor + entropy decode loop, exposed as
    `modular::decode_single_channel`.
  - `BitReader` gains `pu0()` (zero-padded byte align), `pu()`
    (byte-align value), `read_varint()` (A.3.1.5), and a `data()`
    accessor used by entropy coders that switch from bits to bytes.
- DoS-hardening of the Modular decode path against malformed
  channel headers and adversarial entropy streams:
  - `Channel::try_new` refuses dimensions larger than
    `MAX_CHANNEL_DIM` (32 768) per side or pixel counts above
    `MAX_CHANNEL_PIXELS` (256 M); the bitstream-driven entry point
    `decode_single_channel` now uses `try_new` so a forged
    width/height pair returns `InvalidData` instead of asking the
    allocator for terabytes.
  - `MaTree::decode` caps the bit-depth `n` at `MAX_VALUE_BIT_DEPTH`
    (32) so a pathological caller can't make each leaf BEGABRAC
    allocate gigabytes of mantissa context.
  - `decode_subtree` caps the total node count at
    `MAX_MA_TREE_NODES` (1 << 20) and recursion depth at
    `MAX_MA_TREE_DEPTH` (1024), preventing both heap exhaustion and
    stack overflow when the entropy stream keeps emitting "decision
    node" instead of "leaf".
- Regression tests for the hardening above, including a
  hand-crafted 1 M × 1 M channel-header fixture that asserts
  `decode_single_channel` rejects with `InvalidData` rather than
  allocating.

### Changed

- Crate description updated to mention the Modular sub-bitstream
  decode now landed (committee-draft path).
- Doc-comment in `lib.rs` updated to reflect the new module layout
  and the remaining gap toward FDIS 18181-1 (FrameHeader/TOC,
  Squeeze, VarDCT, ANS-based entropy).

### Removed

- `SPEC_BLOCKED.md`: the ISO/IEC 18181-1 normative spec (committee
  draft + FDIS) is now present in `docs/image/jpegxl/`, so the
  block is lifted. Migration to the FDIS layout (ANS entropy,
  FrameHeader, TOC, ImageMetadata FDIS shape) is tracked as the
  next round of work, not a block.
